    <p>The FoodUBank was founded on june 17, 2020 by an ametuer web developer who was inspired to make a difference in the
        community. A collaborative effort was established with a community coordinator at a local church who regulary serves the community by
        giving away free food and making delivery services to elderly people who do not have reliable transport, have a disabilty or don't have
        access to resources. It was through this unified vision that enabled this helping cause to be more fruitful 
        with the goal of being a great resource for many.
