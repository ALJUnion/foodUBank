          <p>In the city of Boston you will find the most diverse and cultured residents around.
            It is a great place to live to raise a family, get access to a great education and find a career path.
            Though despite these great things there is however a high cost of living, which can create a challenge for
            many residents in many neighborhoods. As a result we look to be the solution to these challenges by providing free food
            to those that are in need.
          </p>
          <p>The ability to purchase nutritious food on a daily basis can be difficult for many families and residents,
            especially those who lack income.
            We at FoodUBank want serve our community by helping to remove some of these challenges both in the short and
            long term. We want to serve and be the helping hand that aides in the relief effort of assisiting families as well as
            the less fortunate.
